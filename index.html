                <span>Design, Front-End Development</span>
                <p>Arnergy Solar Limited is a company providing portable electricity for Nigerians using Solar panels.
                    The work was to redesign their website to create a more accessible, simple and consistent
                    experience for their users. As part of the redesign, we discovered that solar panels were esoteric
                    to most users. This allowed us focus more on the services offered by the company, and benefits that
                    come having a solar inverter as opposed to focusing on the technical details of the device.
                    Overall, the redesign covered the landing page, about page, and 4 other pages.</p>

                <h3>ARNERGY IOT DASHBOARD</h3>
                <span>Design</span>
                <p>As part of delivering a unique and complete experience for people who purchased Solar Inverters
                    manufactured by Arnergy, there was a need to design a dashboard that provided users with
                    information about their solar panels and inverters, and allowed them make payments for their
                    services too. This engagement was particularly tricky because generally, solar panels and inverters
                    are highly technical devices so we had to be sure of what to present. The approach taken was
                    extensively interview users to have their sense of what they needed to know, this guided what data
                    was presented on the customers dashboard.</p>

                <span>Design</span>
                <p>Shuttlers is a mobility business that uses technology to help shuttle professionals around Lagos
                    using buses. Shuttlers have a web and mobile app where users are required to book shuttles. As part
                    of my design accelerator program, a colleague and I redesigned the book experience for shuttlers
                    for their web application. The need for a redesign became obvious as research showed the most users
                    relied on the booking channel made available on WhatsApp as opposed on the web and mobile apps.
                    Overall, the redesign focused on the optimizing routes for users who used the platform repeatedly
                    while allowing for easy discoverability of routes for new users.</p>
